#  Curl_noise_flow
This project is based on Entagmas's tutorial: https://entagma.com/houdini-curl-noise-flow/
The tutorial teachs how to create a vector field and create volume trails using said field.
After playing with the setup I found the "vdb advect points" node to be faster and move accurate
everything is rendered in redshift with a basic shader
